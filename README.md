# Government of Turks and Caicos (TCIG) SmartStream GHR HCM Interface
---

# Technical Overview

Purpose of this document is to outline requirements for the Government
of Turks and Caicos HCM Cloud Suite to SmartStream Interface. The
primary purpose of this interface is to load extracted personnel and
payroll data from Infor Cloud Suite.

# Assumptions

# Approach

To meet the business requirements for the Infor Cloud Suite to
SmartStream Extract, a custom SmartStream job scheduler interface will
be created and deployed to the TCIG MS-SQL Servers. TCIG maintains one
SmartStream production environment. The interface will consist of
custom MS-SQL stored procedures, functions, views, and tables. The main
stored procedure will be executed by the SmartStream job scheduler
window.

The interface is dependent on the program CSHCMInterface.exe that
extracts the data changes from Infor Cloud Suite. The program is
executed as a step in the job scheduler job. The data extract is
organized into the following change events:

##### Change Events:

| Event                   | ID   | Stored Procedure           |
|-------------------------|------|----------------------------|
| Update New Hires        | ‘01’ | dbo.usp_ins_new_hires      |
| Employee Salary Changes | ‘02’ | NOT APPLICABLE FOR TCIG  dbo.usp_ins_salary_change  |
| Employee Transfers      | ‘03’ | dbo.usp_perform_transfer   |
| Employee Name Change    | ‘04’ | dbo.usp_ins_name_change    |
| Employee Status Change  | ‘05’ | dbo.usp_ins_status_change  |
| Employee Pay Allowances | ‘06’ | dbo.usp_ins_pay_element    |
| Employee Pay Group      | ‘08’ | dbo.usp_ins_pay_group      |
| Employee Labor Group    | ‘09’ | dbo.usp_ins_labor_group    |
| Employee Position Title | ‘10’ | dbo.usp_ins_position_title |

# SQL Server Procedures

##

## Common Stored Procedure Functionality

For the user defined stored procedures that make the updates to the
SmartStream HCM system, here are the common logic that are shared:

### Infor Cloud Suite Extract File

The imported Infor Cloud Suite extract file is loaded to a custom SQL
Server table, as described in the job scheduler configuration
description section. The main or parent procedure
DBShrpn.dbo.usp_sel_employee_events executes all the sub or child
procedures that update the SmartStream HCM system. This procedure will
declare the temporary table \#ghr_employee_events_temp that all the
child procedures interact with. This allows for the main procedure to
isolate the data from the HCM system, perform data transformations, and
apply basic validation.

### Cursor

All the child procedures executed from the main procedure
DBShrpn.dbo.usp_sel_employee_events, interact with the extract file with
SQL Server cursors. The cursors are declared as FAST_FORWARD which is a
performance-optimized, read-only, forward-only cursor. It is designed
for efficient, sequential retrieval of data when no cursor updates or
backward scrolling are required.

Set-based operations are the preferred method, but the business
requirements for this interface require row-by-row processing.
Row-by-row processing allows for:

-   Row error handling

-   Realtime transaction logging

After the record has been successfully processed, the matching audit
record in table DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_employee_events_aud is updated. The
field proc_flag is updated to ‘Y’ which is used by the verification
report to show that SmartStream has been updated by the record.

### Error Handling

Each SQL Server procedure utilizes CATCH-TRY error handling. This allows
for a more granular level of error reporting. System and row level
errors are logged to the tables that are part of the SmartStream
messaging and custom historical tables.

If a system error Is encountered (i.e. string truncation during table
insert operation) that causes the stored procedure to end, the details
of the error are captured and logged to the custom logging table. To
help identify the source of the error, key blocks of logic code are
labeled with a position name stored in a variable that is included in
the error logging results.

### Database Transactions

For each of the update procedures, when the program is iterating through
the cursor, a database transaction/commit are initiated. This is done to
preserve updates and error logging that were committed prior to
encountered error that causes a rollback of the transaction. This logic
was implemented, because the SmartStream helper procedures are using
their own transaction/commit logic. By committing each transaction in
the loop, an error in the helper procedures will not reverse valid
updates that occurred before the helper procedures were executed. In
addition, the entries in the error logging tables will not be lost
allowing important error details to be conveyed to the user.

### Data Validation

There are two mechanisms for logging and reporting validation messages
for all the SmartStream job scheduler GHR Interface job update process.

-   SmartStream Job Scheduler Messaging Email Report

-   Custom Logging and Verification CSV Report

Both systems use the user defined message ids that are defined in the
message master table: DBSCOMMON.dbo.message_master. Some of the messages
are simple static labels. Others contain a place holder that is 2
characters in length, prefixed with an at symbol (@) followed by a
single digit character (1 – 9). These place holders are used to be
replaced with text that adds detail to the error message text. The
SmartStream Job Scheduler messaging utilizes the place holders in order
to provide more detail in their generic tables. The user defined message
ids with multiple place holders for specific employee details are marked
with ‘Y’ in column msg_text_2.

The SmartStream Email report utilizes these place holder to provide the
details to the error in a single text line. Whereas the custom logging
process just uses the ids for logging purposes. The details of the
errors are captured in table DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_historical_message fields,
as described in the table section.

The messages can be organized by the following categories

-   Simple Static Messages (i.e. ‘\< NEW HIRE SECTION (1) \>’)

-   Labels that contain a single text place holder for aggregate data
    (i.e. employee count - 'Total Global HR Salary Changes: @1')

-   Messages with one or more text place holders to include employee
    detail (i.e. 'National ID was blank for employee, @1 - defaulting to
    ''99999''.').

#### SmartStream Messaging System

The error messages generated are shown in the View Running action button
on the job scheduler window during run time and an email is sent to the
users designated in Mail… action button form. The automatically
generated email is executed by the Job Scheduler poll. Mail recipients
are set in the Mail… action button on the job scheduler activity. The
email distribution is set in the Distribute To section on the form. A
list of multiple email addresses are delimited by a semicolon.

![alt text](images/JobSchedulerSSMsgSys.png)

Error records are logged to table DBSpscb.dbo.psc_messages via executing
stored procedure DBSpscb.dbo.psp_ins_psc_putmsg_2. These records are
visible during the View Now action on the job scheduler window for real
time results. When the job is complete an email of all the messages are
sent to the users setup in the Mail… action button form.

The messages are compiled in each update procedure in a locally declared
temporary table \#tbl_ghr_msg. This table is populated as the procedure
iterates through the applicable records for the update. Once all the
records have been processed in the cursor, the records are copied to
table DBSpscb.dbo.psc_messages for the SmartStream HCM.

##### Issue

This process relies on the independent setup of the mail gateawy with
the SmartStream poll program. In TCIG's case, the mail gateway is
a Unix server that generates the email message. Unix is not completely
compatible with the SmartStream mail gateway protocols. As a result, the
generated email report lacks formatting and line breaks, causing it to
be hard to read and interpret.

#### Custom Logging

In addition to the SmartStream messaging System, a custom logging
process was implemented to store the errors and updates that occurred
for each record in the extract run. It is also the data source for the
Verification CSV Report.

An extract record can have one or more messages dependent on how many
elements require validation before the record can be processed. The
message records are saved to table DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_historical_messages.

####

## DBShrpn.dbo.usp_sel_employee_events

##### Calling Arguments

| None |     |     |
|------|-----|-----|

##### Description

This is the main stored procedure that orchestrates the updates to the
SmartStream HCM system. The procedure transforms the imported extract
data and executes the multiple procedures that update the SmartStream
personnel data.

##### Activity Date

The first step is to lookup up the date the last successful bulk copy
step in the SmartStream Job Schedule GHR Interfaces was ran. The data is
stored in table DBSpscb.dbo.psc_step, field psc_last_comp_date.

##### Load Temporary Table

The procedure creates the temporary table \#ghr_employee_events_temp to
load the current import of the data extract from HCM Cloud Suite that
all the children procedures interact with. A unique id is generated with
an identity column aud_id. Th system date and th audit id are used to
create a primary key for the historical audit table
DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_employee_events_aud.

The table is populated from table DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_employee_events with
the following transformations:

-   Truncates position title (position_title) to 50 characters

-   Capitalizes:

    -   Employer ID - empl_id

    -   Employment Type Code - employment_type_code

    -   Pay Group ID - pay_group_id

    -   Pay Element ID - pay_element_id

-   Data Conversions: The procedure utilizes the TRY_CONVERT function to
    convert the fields listed below. If the text value fails for the
    datetime conversion then a default date of ‘12/31/2999’ is used. If
    the text value fails for either money or float conversions then the
    field is set to 0.00.

    -   Effective Date

    -   Organization Group ID

    -   Pay Rate

    -   Begin Date

    -   End Date

    -   Pay Through Date

    -   Employee Death Date

    -   Employee Calculation Amount

    -   Tax Ceiling Amount

    -   Annual Hours Per FTE

    -   Annual Rate Amount

    -   Birth Date

-   Address Format Code

    -   Default to code Generic 4 ('GN4')


-   Job/Position ID
    - Default position to code '99999'

If no data is present in table DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_employee_events, error
message id U00122 is logged and the process is terminated.

##### Audit Table

The data that has been saved to the temporary table, is copied to the
permanent audit table DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_employee_events_aud. This table is
an archive the processed data and is used in

-   Validation

-   Verification Report

## DBShrpn.dbo.usp_ins_new_hires

| @p_qualifier     | VARCHAR(30) | Qualifier     |
| @p_activity_date | DATETIME    | Activity Date |

##### Description

Creates new associate in the SmartStream HCM system. Utilizes the
SmartStream procedure DBShrpn.dbo.usp_ins_hemp to add the employee.

##### Organization Unit

Organization will not be used in SmartStream. It will be populated with
blanks. The applicable columns are in the extract file, but fields will
be ignored.

##### Hard Coded Settings

Procedure DBShrpn.dbo.usp_ins_hemp has a number of parameters that are
not required in the extract file. The following variables contain the
hard coded value required for executing the procedure.

The procedure performs the following steps when executing the associate
new hire update:

-   Validate data elements

For details, see Validation Error codes at the end if this description.

-   Lookup Tax Entity ID

-   Lookup Next Individual ID

    -   Last assigned Individual id is stored in table
        DBSentp.dbo.entp_human_resources_plcy, column
        gen_indiv_id_last_nbr

    -   After retrieving the value, increment by 1 and then update
        column with new value

    -   Primary key is display_name_format

        -   'LNMSFXCOMFNMFMI'

-   Derive Employee Display Name

    -   Last Name + ‘, ‘ First Name

-   Salary Configuration

    -   The new hire associate’s salary is setup as either Monthly or
        Bi-Weekly.

    -   If the associate’s pay rate (column 16) and annual rate
        (column 39) are equal, this indicates that the associate is paid
        monthly.

    -   The pay rate column is either the hourly rate or annual salary.
        Annual rate value is always the annual salary for both hourly or
        monthly associates.

##### Description

A transfer in SmartStream is defined as when an associate is assigned to
a new existing employer in the HCM system. The transfer is executed if
the associate record successfully passes the validation error messages,
as listed in the Validation Error Codes Used section.

An associate cannot be transferred if their payments have not been:

-   Completely processed

-   Updated into the associate’s accumulators

The procedure iterates through the imported records where the event id
is ‘03’ using a T-SQL cursor. A Record is processed if there are no
fatal validation errors encountered.

The procedure performs the following steps when transferring the
associate to a new employer:

-   Update Employee Employment

Execute procedure DBShrpn.dbo.usp_upd_hrpn_02_trn. Cloned from
SmartStream version DBShrpn.dbo.hsp_upd_hrpn_02. This procedure migrates
the associate to the new employer.

-   Update Payments

Execute procedure DBShrpy.dbo.usp_ins_hpep_02_trn. Cloned from
SmartStream version DBShrpy.dbo.hsp_ins_hpep_02. This procedure
configures the associate’s payment records and accumulators in database
DBShrpy emp_pmt(\*) tables.

-   Update Employee Assignment

A new employee assignment record is automatically created when the
transfer steps are completed.

The associate’s salary, organization, and user defined fields are
updated as necessary.

-   Update Audit Table Processed Flag

Update table DBShrpn.dbo.ghr_employee_events_aud field proc_flag to ‘Y’.
